**Aerodynamics & CFD Engineer | AI/ML for Aerospace | Agentic Coding**

Aerodynamics engineer with 11+ years in the defence industry. M.Sc. research at METU on machine-learning surrogate models for aerodynamic heating prediction.

My work sits at the intersection of computational aerospace engineering and artificial intelligence. I leverage agentic coding tools — Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and multi-agent orchestration — to build engineering software, automate analysis pipelines, and accelerate development workflows that would traditionally take weeks.

**Areas of interest:**
- Agentic coding and AI-assisted software development for engineering applications
- Multi-agent AI orchestration — coordinating specialised AI models across complex tasks
- AI/ML surrogate models for CFD and aerodynamic analysis
- LLM applications for and workflow automation
- Python-based tooling for computational engineering
